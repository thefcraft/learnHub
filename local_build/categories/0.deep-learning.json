The initial videos are more introductory to the library and if you're completely new I recommend you start with those. Just a note, the initial videos are the first videos I created and the quality has improved a lot since then. After you've learned the basics of PyTorch I recommend you to learn about what you find interesting. If you find Computer vision interesting check out architecture implementations, object detection videos, GANs etc. Or if you're curious about NLP then you could check out the Seq2Seq series on machine translation. In summary try to find something you're interested in and then use the videos as a resource if you want more context or get stuck on a specific problem. With time I will cover more areas, and the resource will grow",
